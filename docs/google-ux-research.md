## CSS Library/Templates:

The primary goal in leveraging a CSS library is to speed up prototyping and design work. Using Google's design language documentation as reference will allow us to customize pre-existing elements within these libraries and templates in order to produce a UI that resembles something out of Google's software suit.

## Software for UI/UX Prototyping

Using software to prototype and adjust our UI and UX design as we go allows us to be flexible with our designs and use cases. Using the information listed above while designing will provide with valuable milestone deliverables for the client as the UX shifts and evolves. It also allows the client themselves to make recommendations on the fly that they will be able to visualize in a timely manner without as much development work.
